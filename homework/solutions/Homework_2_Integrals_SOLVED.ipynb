    "## 2 Calculating $\\pi$ using random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A very peculiar thing to do is calculate the value of $\\pi$.\n",
    "As you might know, $\\pi$ is an irrational number and therefore, cannot be easily calculated using fractions. So one approach to calculate $\\pi$ is by using its properties as the circle number.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Pi_statistisch.png)\n",

    "The idea is the following: The ratio of the area of a circle relative to the area of a square gives you $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Area~of~circle}}{\\mathrm{Area~of~square}} = \\dfrac{\\pi \\cdot r^2}{(2r)^2} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to approach the area statistically, we can generate a large amount of random points in the square and then ask Python whether the point is within the circle (see the image, the red dots). The condition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 + y^2 \\le 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how to go over it:\n",
    " - Initiate two variables: \n",
    "    1. The total number of points, e.g. `nr_total = 100000`\n",
    "    1. the number of points within the circle, has to be `nr_circle = 0`\n",
    " - Build a `for` loop over the number of random points you want, `nr_total`.\n",
    " - Then generate two random numbers for it, one `x` and one `y` value. Use the the `random.random()` function from the `random` library for both. The function generates a random float in the interval $[0, 1.0)$.\n",
    " - Then use an `if-else` statement to ask Python whether the point (x,y) is within the circle (with the condition above)\n",
    " - If the answer is `True`, then add `1` to the `nr_circle` variable.\n",
    " - After the loop, calculate $\\pi$ using the formula above. The area of the circle is corresponding to the number of points in the circle."
