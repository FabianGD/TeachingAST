I designed this four part tutorial for the Master course "Chemistry of Materials" at the University of Jena in 2020.
It's my first programming tutorial, so it might be a bit rough around the edges.

## The course

The tutorial is comprised of four sessions that explain the basics of writing code in Python.

The course is based on Jupyter notebooks. So you will either need a [Jupyter environment](https://jupyter.org/) running locally or a remote Jupyter notebook,
such as [binder](https://mybinder.org) (you can click the badge above!)

We start out in pure Python first (Hello World, functions, arithmetics, lists etc.) and later switch to using the NumPy library as the main mathematics workhorse.
Each of the sessions takes around 3-4 hours to complete (at least that's the amount of time it took in the Zoom sessions).

To compliment the course, there are a two homework notebooks to get your hands dirty.
